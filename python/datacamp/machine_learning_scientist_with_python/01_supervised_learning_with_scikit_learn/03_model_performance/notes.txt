Notes

Class imbalance - some samples are in greater quantity than other classes
Confusion matrix can avoid the issues with just using the accuracy
precision = tp/tp+fp
recall = tp/tp+fn aka sensitivity
accuracy = tp/tp+tn

f1 score = harmonic mean of precision and recall = 2 * (precision*recall)/(precision + recall)
f1 score  favors models with similar precison and recall
