Example 1 - Acme Cosmetics
What's Gross Sales?. 
https://www.accountingtools.com/articles/what-is-the-difference-between-gross-sales-and-net-sales.html
So gross sales is total income withour considering the deductions.
Observation:- 
1. Unit prices are drcreasing. 
2. Social expenditures are increasing.
3. Ad costs are decreasing. 
4. Target sales are not met. 
Define - Disassemble - Evaluate - Decide

Data Analysis requires some process. My summary is below.
1. Find your question
2. Find what you want to answer the question from the data
3. Check the information you found is correct
4. Now decide whether your analysis result is good. 
Above steps sounds good when we have some idea what we are looking for. What 
to do if there is no question?: exploratory data analysis? May be. Then there 
is hypothesis testing. 

Problem: 
So the boss wants to improve the sales. i.e. match gross sales with target.
