# Object-Oriented principles in PHP

## Constructs
- ## 01 Class
  - Find the noun in the problem statement
  - Use that as your Class name in php
  - A constructor is a special method that is called when an object is created
- ## 02 Object
  - An instance of a class
  - A class is a blueprint for an object
  - An object is a concrete instance of a class
  - `...$params` is a variadic function that accepts any number of arguments
- ## 03 Inheritance
- `is a` relationship between classes that `extends` from a parent class
- child class can `override` the parent class method
- ## 04 Abstract Classes
- a way to avoid repetition of attributes and behaviour among similar classes
- similarly bastract function can be used to indicate what type of behaviour can be expected by default in the sub classes
- Similar to templates (EXPAND)
- ## 05 Handshakes and Interfaces
